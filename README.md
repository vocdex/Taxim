# Taxim: An Example-based Simulation Model for GelSight Tactile Sensors
This fork is modified for using Taxim with Digit tactile sensor.   
Check the results section for simulated images of DIGIT.
Make sure to modify the calibration file paths inside simOptical.py and simMarkMotionField.py for your calibration files.


Taxim is an example-based simulator for GelSight tactile sensors and its variations. For more information of Taxim, you can check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04027) or the [webpage](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch/taxim-simulation/).

## Installation and Prerequisites
Basic dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, cv2

To install dependencies: 
```bash
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
'pip install nanogui'
```
## Usage
If you want to customize the Taxim on your own sensor, please follow the DataCollection and Calibration to calibrate the Taxim and generate calibration files. And modify the parameters under `Basic.params` and `Basic.sensorParams` accordingly.

We provide a set of calibration files and you can work with them directly. You can follow instruction of Optical Simulation and Marker Motion Field Simulation to start working with the provided examples. And feel free to change the parameters under `Basic.params`.

## Data Collection (optional)
1. Connect a GelSight sensor with your pc and launch the camera driver.
2. Change the `self.gel_sub` in `gelsight.py` to your sensor camera's topic.
3. Run `python record_Gel.py` and input the file name and number of frames to collect the data.

## Calibration (optional)
1. Generate data pack: Run `python generateDataPack.py -data_path DATA_PATH` where `DATA_PATH` is the path to the collected raw tactile data. Hand annotate the contact center and radius for each tactile image. `dataPack.npz` will be saved under the `DATA_PATH`.
2. Generate polynomial table: Run `python polyTableCalib.py -data_path DATA_PATH` where `DATA_PATH` is the path to the data pack. `polycalib.npz` will be saved under the `DATA_PATH`.
3. Generate shadow table: Run `python generateShadowMasks.py -data_path DATA_PATH` where `DATA_PATH` is the path to the collected shadow calibration images. `shadowTable.npz` will be saved under the `DATA_PATH`.
4. Generate FEM tensor maps: Export the ANSYS FEM displacement txt files and set the path in the main function. Run `python generateTensorMap.py` and `femCalib.npz` will be saved under `calibs` folder.

All the calibration files from a GelSight sensor have been provided under `calibs` folder.

## Optical Simulation
You can input a point cloud of a certain object model and define the pressing depth, or directly input a depth map. All the parameters in `Basic.params` are adjustable. `depth` is in millimeter unit.

Run `python simOptical.py -obj square -depth 1.0` to visualize the examples. Results are saved under `results`.


## Marker Motion Field Simulation
You can input a point cloud of a certain object model and define the loads on x, y, z directions. `dx` and `dy` are shear loads and `dz` is normal loads, which are all in millimeter unit.
Run `python simMarkMotionField.py -obj square -dx 0.3 -dy 0.4 -dz 0.5` to visualize the resultant displacements. Results are saved under `results`.
